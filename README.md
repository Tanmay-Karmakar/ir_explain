# ir_explain

`ir_explain` is an open-source Python library that implements a variety
of well-known techniques for Explainable IR (ExIR) within
a common, extensible framework. It supports the three standard
categories of post-hoc explanations, namely pointwise, pairwise,
and listwise explanations.

<!-- `ir_explain` is a post-hoc explainability library of IR. It consists of three componets, i) pointwise, ii) pairwise, iii) listwise.
