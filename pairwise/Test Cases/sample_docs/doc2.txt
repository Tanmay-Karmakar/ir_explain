"The impacts of climate change are profound, especially on polar ice caps. Scientists have observed that the Antarctic ice sheet is losing mass. The melting ice contributes to global sea level rise and has significant implications for coastal regions worldwide. Additionally, the thawing permafrost in polar regions releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas, which accelerates climate change The changes in ice cover also affect marine ecosystems and human activities"
