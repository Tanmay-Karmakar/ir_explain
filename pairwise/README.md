# Pairwise Setup

The Utils module includes all necessary imports, and code for ir_axioms and explain_more can be imported from their respective folders. An example notebook demonstrates the use of the pointwise explainer on a sample query from the TREC-DL-2019 dataset, using two sampled documents. The pairwise explainer is employed to further elucidate the differences in ranking between these two documents.
